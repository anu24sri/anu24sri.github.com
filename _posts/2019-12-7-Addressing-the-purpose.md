So the first bolg post has been pending a long time. Yes! for the good old 4 months. So it was my first semester at my Masters and I was overwhelmed to be honest. Talking about it, there is lot more to learn, lot more to strive for and lot more to execute.
The only thing I am fastened on, is to not repeat the mistakes I had made in my Bachelors. I have been constantly pulling myself on to the main road.
Enough on the Academia. Let's get to the point.
*Why this blog?*

Starting a bog had been on my mind since couple of years now. But in my mind I always lacked the structure to it. But again, I badly wanted to be vocal about my thoughts because weirdly enough,I got to realise that I have intutive opinions on topics.
So firstly, the blog will be on my opinions on different wherabouts, events and activities in this world. I really love a healthy debate, whwere I get to know the opinions of others and rather more than half of the time I am just 
listening and observing. But this blog will be where I will be vocal about where the things are heading to in this vast world.

Now secondly, I am a tech person, hell I am doing masters in VLSI. If I shall be honest,I was initially in denial of my choice, but now I am loving it. I am enjoying understanding the background of our technology. All of this is giving a very very 
new perspective of the technologically developing world. So I will write articles on the topics, I feel are really important to understand as an electronics engineer. This comes from the various doubts, my colleagues and me had during our course of study.
Third aspect is my constant struggle to be accountable to many of my goals, my struggeles on a daily basis to be an individual, I desire myself to become. So yeah regular update on my work schedule will do the purpose.

Finally, this is all about the "Whys", so what next. I am committing myself to write an update on the weekly basis. This will neither be too intimiating nor too relaxing. Will be sufficient to keep a check on me.
Other things will hopefully follow through.

*Cheers to the new journey!*
