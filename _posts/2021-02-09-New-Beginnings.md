So a bit of briefing, I can't possibly give any excuse for not posting the whole damn year. All the 2020 jokes aside, the year gave us hell lot of time!! Well I would say it's all
the matter of priorities. And as far as productivity is concerned, I feel 2020 was the year of introspection and transition for me. I obviously ended up working on myself, can't be more grateful.
Now that new year has started, I think eveybody has been addressing 2020 a lot lately. Well I would spare you that. Moving ahead with today's post. 

For the ones, who knew my blog existed and are aware of the 2 odd posts that were marinating on my blog, well I am deleting those. I feel I should start afresh. I had sucha struggle to create this one, 
being from non CS background but I am glad I did, it was fun. Anyway, I have better plans, more dedication and better structure for this blog. This owes to the fact that I feel like a different(better) 
person post lockdown.

**The purpose**

As most of the people might already know, I am currently in the final sem of my M.Tech, placed in a company which is among the best in the electronics industry. So that is sorted as of now.
I feel there are lot more things I can include in a single day and life in general. The basic aim is to have a more flexible, productive lifestyle. Time management is one take away from 2020.
That's also one thing I feel I need to improve on. I have started the week on a positive note and scheduling will be the focus of the week. WFH is so intimidating honestly when one is just
strarting out in the industry. I will be updating on a weekly basis of my progress, which also means there will be a post a week.

**The new life**

I won't really talk about the work here, honestly I am just figuring out how things work. I would say, so far so good. There have been highs and lows in last 2 weeks which I think is acceptable.
The mood on work front is probably exhibiting SHM right now :P The social life had gone bonkers but now I have started to meet friends, get to know new people. Covid had constrained me to know 
them only virtually and that was exhausting on a whole different level but boy! I am glad I got to now them! So much to learn from people I tell you! Catching up on old friends has been fun 
obviously. Meeting someone new has a whole different level of fun and excitement associated with it. But again, managing time is really crucial.

Concluding I would say, this blog is all about how I see life, where I see my life going and most importantly keep myself accountable. Sharing it here stops me from being stagnant. I would also
post things related to socio-economic aspect that's definitely there on my mind. So cool, hoping things to have fun journey!! <p>&#128516 </p>
